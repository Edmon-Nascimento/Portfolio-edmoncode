# Edmon Nascimento — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio. This project was created to showcase who I am, the technologies I work with, and some of the projects I’ve built so far.

##  About the Project

This is a responsive, accessible, and modern portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as a digital space where I introduce myself, share my skills, and present real projects I’ve worked on, including a special wedding attendance form created using EmailJS.
